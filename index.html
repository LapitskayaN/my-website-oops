    <p>    Create a local Git folder named "my-website-oops".
      In this folder, create a file index.html (you can copy and paste an HTML skeleton from here).
      Make three commits of your choice (for example, create index.html, update title, add paragraphs, etc.).
      Display the history of commits using the command git log --oneline.
      Undo the changes from the third commit using the git command of your choice. Warning: this must not be destructive to the files on your computer.
      Display the commit history again using the command git log --oneline a new element must signal the cancellation of the modifications related to the third commit.
      Copy the contents of your Terminal from the first one git log --oneline (step 4 of these instructions) to the end and paste it in an pastebin.
      Share the pastebin link created as a solution to this challenge.</p>
